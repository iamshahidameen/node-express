          <p>Date: July 14, 1991 
          </p><p> 
          </p><p>The following comments relate to point I. "Protection of Computer 
            Related Inventions", subpoint c) "The Supreme Court has found 
            that new and useful computer program-related inventions are eligible for 
            patent protection. What rationale, if any, exists in law or policy for 
            Congress to now remove patent protection for this field of science and 
            technology?" 
          </p><p> 
          </p><h2>SUMMARY OF POSITION. </h2>
          <p>1. Computer Programs are Writings. As such, they should be subject to 
            copyright law (narrowly interpreted) or trade secret protection, but not 
            patent law. As writings, programs should be protected against any attempt 
            by government to license what can be written. This includes well-intentioned 
            but mistaken legal or policy arguments which create de facto censors and 
            censorship under another name, viz. patent examiners and patent examination. 
          </p><p>Such censorship and restraint on freedom of expression of software writers 
            is anathema in a free society, and a violation of the First Amendment. 
            That software patents are a severe violation of the rights of speech of 
            programmers has not yet been widely recognized; this is perhaps in part 
            because most lawyers, judges and politicians are still insufficiently 
            knowledgeable regarding computers to realize that writing a computer program 
            is in fact a form of writing, not significantly more arcane than writing 
            music, mathematics, scientific papers, or for that matter, laws. All of 
            these forms of speech, including writing programs, deserve full protection 
            under the First Amendment. 
          </p><p>2. Central Planning or Licensure of Good Ideas in Software Won't Work. 
            Just as any attempt to centralize or classify all original (or "non-obvious") 
            literary, musical, or scientific writings in the patent office would fail, 
            so any attempt to centralize information regarding all innovative software 
            programs will also fail. No human can know all of software relevant to 
            any large subject, just as no human can know all that has been written 
            on any large subject, and for the same reasons. Current and near-term 
            innovations in the writing of software will cause the amount of software 
            developed every year by the one million professional programmers in the 
            U.S. to grow at an ever-increasing rate. As a result, the burden of central 
            licensing of innovation by the patent office will grow steadily more onerous, 
            creating unnecessary and costly barriers to software progress. 
          </p><p>3. Patents on Writings Discourage Trial and Error Perfection of Ideas. 
            Rather than allowing government to restrict different expressions of the 
            same important idea, by patents or otherwise, public policy should recognize 
            that the more important the idea, the more important it is to support 
            the freest possible variation of expression, in order to rapidly perfect 
            the idea. The intense competition of commercial software in recent years, 
            and the rapid improvements in software practice which the free market 
            in software has hitherto engendered, strongly validates this theory in 
            practice. 
          </p><h2>ELABORATION. </h2>
          <h3>1. Computer Programs are Writings. </h3>
          <p>Anyone who has ever written both a program and an essay knows how similar 
            these complex endeavors are. Both require use of all one's skill and knowledge. 
            Both involve continual invention and creativity. Both require constant 
            revision. Both evolve with time, as one's knowledge grows. Both are written 
            in a language which has a vocabulary that can be used in an infinite variety 
            of ways. Although software is often a less direct method of communication 
            than prose, in that there may be many intermediaries between a particular 
            programmer and the end-user of an application which uses a piece of his 
            or her code, the same is true for other forms of expression. Theater goers, 
            for example, don't directly read theater scripts, but see and hear them 
            acted by intermediaries (actors); nonetheless, the scripts are writings. 
          </p><p>Neither essays nor software are written with primary attention to "What 
            has someone else said?", much less "What has the official licenser/patent 
            examiner pronounced?" Rather, both are written with attention to 
            solving a particular problem or achieving an objective of importance to 
            the writer. In both cases, any similarity to the works of others normally 
            comes about because of similarity in the problems which are being addressed, 
            and not because of slavish copying of either ideas or implementations 
            of others. 
          </p><p>Writing programs today is no more esoteric than writing prose once was, 
            and writing music still is. Until a few hundred years ago, literacy was 
            a rarity. Acquiring the ability to write prose took training. It still 
            does, but nowadays we teach writing to everyone in schools. Other forms 
            of writing, such as writing music or writing computer programs, are treated 
            as optional, but we still recognize them as writing. Even though the notes 
            don't sing by themselves -- they have to be played -- we recognize the 
            writing of music as a form of speech or expression. 
          </p><p>Similarly, although a program has to be run to be used, before it can 
            be run it has to be written. There are now millions of individuals in 
            the U.S.A. who know how to write a computer program. It is an absurdity 
            to expect those millions of individuals to perform patent searches or 
            any other kind of search prior to the act of writing a program to solve 
            a specific problem. If others wish to purchase a program, as with the 
            sale of written prose and written music, absolutely no patent restrictions 
            should be placed on the ability of authors to sell or publish their own 
            writings. To do otherwise is to confuse the player piano (which is patentable) 
            with the specific arrangement of notes on a specific player piano roll 
            (which is indeed subject to copyright, but not to patenting). 
          </p><p>Regrettably, the courts have allowed the patent office to be placed in 
            the position of promoting de facto censorship of the work of over 1,000,000 
            employed writers of computer software, along with the several million 
            additional amateur writers of computer software. All these millions of 
            citizens are now asked to censor their own writings, or have them reviewed 
            and censored by third parties or the courts. Whenever and wherever the 
            patent office issues a software patent, software authors must now plead 
            with patent holders to grant - for a price - licenses to speak as they 
            choose; and the patent holder is under no obligation to grant these licenses. 
          </p><p>Suppression of free thought and speech in software (writing, or publishing) 
            is an evil, even when only a small number of individuals recognize that 
            speech is being restricted, or what the costs will be if this harmful 
            censorship-by-another-name, viz "patent licensure", is now allowed 
            to expand unchecked. 
          </p><p>The grant by any agency of government of the exclusive right to speak 
            in software, and the enforced branding by government of all alternative 
            expressions of the same or similar ideas (algorithms) as illegal is inherently 
            harmful. It is to say, in effect, "Don't try to solve problems and 
            invent solutions as you see fit; you or your software agents might independently 
            write or invent something which the patent office's licensers have placed 
            on the Index of Banned Algorithms; in which case, at their discretion, 
            they can force you into an expensive, traumatic legal Inquisition..." 
          </p><p>Under the First Amendment, the freedom to speak or write may not be abridged 
            by any branch of government or by any government licensee. This holds 
            regardless of the good or bad intentions of those who argue otherwise. 
          </p><h3> 2. Central Planning or Licensing of Good Ideas in Software Won't Work. 
          </h3>
          <p>Requiring writers of software to know all potentially relevant patents 
            is the same as requiring writers of literature to have read all potentially 
            significant works of literature before ever setting pen to paper. It is 
            not possible; and even if it were, it is not desirable. 
          </p><p>The main costs of software patents are not in the past or present; they 
            are in the future. As programming literacy increases, and as Object-Oriented 
            Programming, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, and Computer Aided Software 
            Engineering techniques expand, the volume, breadth, complexity, and scale 
            of software written will continue to expand exponentially. 
          </p><p>As this happens, the percentage of all that is worth knowing about software 
            which can be known by a single person will continue to drop exponentially. 
            This applies to software writers, and also to software readers, users, 
            and reviewers, including patent examiners. No one can know much of what 
            is non-obvious and innovative in software, even today; tomorrow, the problem 
            will be even worse. 
          </p><p>We are now entering the era when programs can write and edit other programs, 
            and where it will simply not be possible for anyone to know which programs 
            have evolved or been automatically revised to the point of similarity 
            with other programs, innovative or not. Furthermore, new programs and 
            algorithms will be written at the rate of the computer programs running 
            to create them, not at the rate of the computer programmers typing code 
            line by line. 
          </p><p>At this point, software patents will go from being unworkable to being 
            widely and deservedly recognized as impossible. For not only will they 
            become impossible to enforce; they will become impossible to comply with. 
            In the meantime, real companies will have to pay real lawyers increasing 
            sums to try to avoid lawsuits, negotiate otherwise unnecessary cross- 
            licensing agreements, and continually waste time, money, attention and 
            energy on these and other defensive, rear-guard activities which will 
            add nothing to America's productivity or actual stock of inventive software. 
          </p><p>Allowing patents in software is tantamount to asking each individual 
            programmer to know what all the other millions of programmers on Earth 
            are currently doing or have already done. Requiring such omniscience by 
            software writers is a sure way to force them into civil disobedience, 
            if not intentionally, then after they find that they increasingly and 
            unwittingly are nevertheless violating patents of which they cannot adequately 
            remain current or aware. When the law begins to tell people to do what 
            is impossible, disobedience and disrespect for the law are the inevitable 
            result. 
          </p><p>Thus, the only thing which software patents can do is create increasingly 
            arbitrary and costly roadblocks to progress, including crucial progress 
            in using new tools and techniques for writing software. 
          </p><p>Since promoting innovation is the primary rationale for patents, and 
            since patents instead serve to impede innovation when it comes to software, 
            and will increasingly impede innovation as the volume of software continues 
            to expand, it is quite clear that patents should not be applied to software 
            writings for this reason alone, independent of the First Amendment issues 
            discussed earlier. 
          </p><p>Similar considerations argue against a broad interpretation of copyrights, 
            including broad "look and feel" claims. The burden of proof 
            should always be on the copyright holder to prove substantive and thorough 
            copying or reverse engineering. Like writers of literature, writers of 
            software should not be expected to constantly look over their shoulders 
            out of fear that someone someday may try to sue them due to partial or 
            accidental similarities with the works of others. Broad interpretations 
            of copyright are even worse than patents in this respect, because claims 
            of copyright infringement can be made by almost any party in any field, 
            without significant time limit, and without any requirement to state publicly 
            in advance exactly what aspects of one's work are sufficiently unique 
            to deserve copyright protection. As a result, the idea of copyright protection, 
            coherent when applied to a specific piece of writing, becomes incoherent 
            and requires de facto omniscience if applied to all possible variations 
            on all existing pieces of writing. 
          </p><p>Because the focus of this analysis is on patent law and software, further 
            discussion of the dangers of broadly interpreted copyrights should take 
            place elsewhere. 
          </p><p> 
          </p><h3>3. Patents on Writings Discourage Trial and Error Perfection of Important 
            Ideas. </h3>
          <p>Whenever a patent is granted on a particular expression of an idea in 
            software, it will have a chilling effect on everyone who is considering 
            writing software to solve similar problems. They must now tread gingerly 
            lest their writings be later judged to overlap with the area that has 
            had exclusive title granted to the patent holder; this holds even if their 
            expression was independently derived, and even if it is a superior solution 
            to the same problem. Given the manifest unpredictability of court decisions, 
            many people will prudently decide not to innovate in areas in which someone 
            has already been granted a patent. This is a perverse way to encourage 
            invention. 
          </p><p>Favoritism by a government official towards "non-obvious" (i.e. 
            important) software innovations is like favoritism by government towards 
            specific religious writings or specific commercial products in the marketplace: 
            it's an inherently bad idea. The idea that one party's writings on a subject 
            shall be certified by the Executive branch of the government, and all 
            other expressions suppressed, would appear very strange to those who wrote 
            the constitution. 
          </p><p>Like a work of fiction, the value of a sophisticated work of software 
            is not in the simple plot idea, but in the complex telling of the tale. 
            It is only those unfamiliar with the strong feelings, beliefs and preferences 
            which exist among writers of software regarding alternative expressions 
            of the same software ideas who could believe that differences in expression 
            of the "same" idea are unimportant to those who write software, 
            or to those who use software written by others. 
          </p><p>Imagine if, for 17 years, only one author was allowed to write about 
            the plot line "boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy regains girl". 
            Or that once some consortium of artists has invented rock and roll or 
            string quartets (and produced an initial "reduction to practice"), 
            no one else could write music in those styles for 17 years without their 
            permission. Or that once the first mathematician has invented a technique 
            for dividing numbers, all other mathematicians must for 17 years request 
            permission before inventing their own techniques, for fear of accidentally 
            reinventing or coming too close to reinventing what another mathematician 
            has also thought about. In each of these cases, imagine the arrogance 
            of someone claiming a right to bring before a court of law and convict 
            of a civil crime all others who choose to think for themselves and write 
            independently. 
          </p><p>Any assertion that some one individual or organization can ever rightfully 
            establish exclusive ownership of the use or refinement of abstract ideas 
            - obvious or non-obvious, important or unimportant - embodied in a work 
            of prose, music, mathematics, or software, should trouble the conscience 
            of everyone whose creative work is built, as it necessarily must be, in 
            part or in whole, out of ideas and techniques discovered and developed 
            by others. 
          </p><p>The notion that the better the idea, the better it is to grant one author 
            a monopoly over all possible expressions of that idea is perverse. It 
            is precisely the most important ideas which deserve the most varied and 
            thorough exploration. The more important or innovative the area of discourse, 
            the more important it is to avoid government favoritism or censorship 
            of thought or expression. Letting the government grant monopoly licenses 
            to only the most important ("non-obvious") new ideas does not 
            make such licensing better, but worse. 
          </p><p>In addition to being harmful to the freedom of expression and experimentation 
            with ideas by others, patents on software are also unnecessary. As with 
            any complex novel or movie, significant works of software necessarily 
            involve significant complexity and detail. Barring direct copying, which 
            can and should be prevented by copyright law, the expertise and judgement 
            involved in creating and continually improving any complex piece of software 
            provides inherent protection against would- be competitors; those who 
            invest in writing such complex software master the intricacies of the 
            problem they are solving far better than any pure copycat competitor is 
            likely to achieve. Asking for more protection than this, however, is asking 
            too much. In all walks of life one makes investments which one would like 
            to protect. But where granting protection for some involves imposing licensing 
            requirements on others, we should always err on the side of forbearance. 
            Software which is complex and original enough to deserve patent protection 
            doesn't need it; and software which is simple enough to require patent 
            protection doesn't deserve it. 
          </p><p>Like censorship of religious speech in the 17th century, the issue here 
            is not what the original justifications were (software patents as incentives 
            to invention, etc.), but rather, how we can eliminate a dangerous, but 
            avoidable, error: restrictive licensure of software; and how we can, instead, 
            re-establish full freedom of speech in the writing and publishing of computer 
            programs.

            of many colleagues, including: Ravi Pandya, Mark Miller, John Walker, 
            Marc Stiegler, Chip Morningstar, Chris Hibbert, Chris Peterson, Eric Drexler, 
            Eric Tribble, Nick Whyte, Gayle Pergamit, Roger Gregory, Robin Hanson, 
            Michael McClary, Paul Baclaski, Rick Mascitti, Kimball Collins, and Bob 
            Schumaker. Any error or inelegance of expression, however, remains the 
            responsibility of the author. 
          </p><p>The ideas in these comments have been evolving over a period of years, 
            and may be to some extent original with the author. However, there is 
            a wider intellectual climate within which they are shared. Several colleagues 
            who share the general views expressed in this document have attached their 
            signatures. They are almost all writers of software. 
          </p><p>Authors of non-software whose writings have heavily influenced my thinking 
            regarding the severe dangers and foolishness of even attempting to centrally 
            plan or license spontaneous areas of human endeavor such as the writing 
            of software, are: F.A. Hayek (Law, Legislation, and Liberty); Karl Popper 
            (Conjectures and Refutations); and Michael Polanyi (Personal Knowledge). 
          </p><p>As President of a small company which is currently working day and night 
            on developing an innovative software-based product, I do not have much 
            free time to participate in public policy issues. I had not until recently 
            planned to attempt to write my views on the subject of software patents 
            and copyrights until a few years from now, when I would have more leisure 
            to fully research, critique, and elaborate on them. However I have decided 
            to make these views public at this time, in somewhat "raw" form, 
            as a contribution to regulatory proceedings which I consider to be of 
            the utmost importance. 
          </p><p>I apologize for any lack of familiarity with the fine points of current 
            patent law as it is currently being applied to software. My whole point 
            is that any such details are necessarily irrelevant once one recognizes 
            that patents should not be applied to any form of writing, including the 
            writing of computer software.

          </p><p>We the undersigned are in substantial agreement with the argument here, 
            and hold that for these reasons as well as others, patents should not 
            be granted in computer software.</p>
